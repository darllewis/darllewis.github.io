<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My research applies formal and empirical techniques
to study federalism and intergovernmental relations. I explore
federalism and intergovernmental relations, with a particular focus on
the United States of America. The United States has successfully
maintained a federated system of dual sovereignty between the states
and the national government for nearly 250 years. My research develops
models to understand the mechanisms driving this success with an eye
towards the current state of other nations, including several
Commonwealth states and the European Union.</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Local
Externalities and Federal Policy-Making: </b>In many cases,
local
policies have effects that reach beyond the bounds of the implementing
jurisdictions. These externalities, unrealized by the local
jurisdicition but by surrounding jurisdicitions, can impose heavy costs
on surrounding districts. &nbsp;As a result, there are often
incentives for serveral districts to impose a uniform national policy
that preempts local discretion and mitigate these externalities.
&nbsp; </font></li>

Interest, National Commerce, and the Federal Judiciary:</a></b>
In
the early years of the United States, the national judiciary was
exceedingly weak, hearing only a small range of cases.&nbsp; During
the 19th century, though, the power of the federal judiciary expanded
greatly, especially after the Civil War.&nbsp; This paper develops
a model which incorporates the Federalist founders' concerns about
local biases in judicial proceedings and shows that this fear
incentivized Whigs and later Republicans to increasingly support a
strong centralized judiciary over the course of the century in line
with the development of a national economy, beginning out of the
Northeast.&nbsp; In contrast, the more agrarian Southern and
Western states resisted these changes which prevented them from
repudiating debt in the lead-up to and aftermath of the Civil
War.&nbsp; Throughout this period, Northeastern states experienced
relatively better access to interstate and international credit than
their southern neighbors, as predicted by the model.</font></li>
<br>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Preemting
Preemption in Federal Systems:</b> This paper develops a formal
model of rule making in federal systems where uniform rules are
desirable, but resisted by ideologically diverse states.&nbsp;
While individual states initially set their own rules, they do so under
the threat of preemption by a national legislature that is able to
impose a uniform standard nationwide whenever variation across states
becomes too large.&nbsp; As this is costly to extreme states from
an ideological perspective, those states can unilaterally decide to
partially moderate their own rules relative to the rest of the
federation in an effort to disincentivize such a legislative act and
thereby preempt the preemption.&nbsp; I analyze these rule making
outcomes in both a single-shot format and repeated play where the
legislature acts probabilistically, with individual and social welfare
implications for both.</font></li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Policy-Making
with Outside Options:</b> In Political Science, most models
assume that policies apply uniformly across the population.
&nbsp;However, there are many types of policies that do not affect
everyone equally. &nbsp;Some policies are targeted towards
particular populations on the basis of fixed characteristics and still
more that affect only those individuals that choose to engage in
certain behaviors. &nbsp;Examples of such polies are those that
relate to driving, political activity, and business activity. </font></li>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/%7Eglewis/working/policy-bias-options.pdf"><b>Policy
and Bias with Outside Options: The Case of Unites States Foreclosure
Policy:</b></a> When analyzing voting behavior, most
analyses focus
on policy preferences of individuals who are bound by the policies
implemented by the electorate of those politicians that win office. In
many policy realms, however,&nbsp; the constituent voters are
subjected to the implemented policy only if they choose to engage in
certain activities.&nbsp; This project focuses on one such policy
area: foreclosure law.&nbsp; While elected politicians enact
relevant policies, only those voters that choose to participate in the
mortgage market are directly affected by those policies.&nbsp;
Individuals that do not wish to participate in the mortgage market may
instead choose to rent their homes, pay cash, or live with other family
members and thereby avoid falling subject to foreclosure law.&nbsp;
This paper develops a formal model and empirical analysis of
policy-making and economic outcomes in such environments. </font></li>

<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Committee
Agenda Setting:</b> While there is a wide literature on committee
decision-making processes, the manner in which committees determine
their agendas is less-studied. &nbsp;When there is an elective
agenda, committee members may differ on which matters to take up,
leading to conflict prior to the final decision-making stage. </font></li>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/%7Eglewis/working/dynamic-committee-decision.pdf">Dynamic
Committee Decision-Making (with Ben Johnson):</a></b>
We focus on committee decision-making in a dynamic context. We present
a model that demonstrates how committee members tradeoff between
certainty in the moment against expectations about the future. We show
that when a decision is made affects what decision is made. Under mild
conditions, some players take losses instead of a zero payout in the
present in an effort to prevent a worse loss in the future, something
we call a sacrifice region. Our model has implications for
agenda-setting and committee decision-making more broadly. We apply our
model to a court's agenda-setting procedures, an admissions committee,
and jury selection process. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Under

<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Finance
&nbsp;and Educational Outcomes:</b> The structure of
educational markets varies from the structur of many traditional
markets due to the unique demands of several actors. &nbsp;Rather
than a simple transaction between students and schools, the market for
education is a multi-sided one in which students, schools, employers,
and governments interact together.</font></li>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Local
Politics and Access to Higher Education:</b> Unlike in their
earlier educational careers, in the post-secondary environemnt,
students must decide the level of quality and engagement in their own
education. &nbsp;Meanwhile, universities, employers, and
governments also maintain preferences over the educational market that
they may attempt to influence. &nbsp;this project applies formal
models to develop empirical predictions regarding the educational
choices of indivuals and universities in light of the financial
political economy of higher education.</font></li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Media
Markets and Policital Waves:</b> Since the 1990s, political
campaigns in the United States have become increasingly nationalized.
&nbsp;As a result, national issues and national sentiments are
becoming increasingly important in local races. &nbsp;This
introduces new challenges to our understanding of local campaigns and
the effects of media coverage.</font></li>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Media
Markets, Wave Elections, and the Incumbency Advantage:</b>
High levels of media market congruence benefit challengers by making
local issues more salient, including the records of local incumbents.
However, this effect may fluctuate across electoral cycles as broader
state or national moods vary. In particular, those incumbents that are
generally the most-vulnerable due to high levels of congruence may
instead obtain an advantage when there is a strong national trend, as
they are better-able to emphasize local issues and issues that
distinguish them from the national norm, making it more difficult for
challengers to ’ride the wave’ into office.</font></li>
